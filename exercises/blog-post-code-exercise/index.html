                    <li>Living by the sean means clener air
                        <p> It’s official. Sea air is cleaner and less polluted. 
                            According to science, the air in nature areas, like 
                            forests and areas of water, contains more negative 
                            ions compared to built up areas. These ions are our 
                            friends. They elevate serotonin, a mood regulator, 
                            and boost our day time energy levels.
                        </p>
                        <p>Plus, coastal life means more sunlight because we’re 
                           more likely to spend time outdoors. Good news for the 
                           long, cold winter months, and for those who 
                           experience a dip in mood as the seasons change. 
                           Maybe it’s an argument for a little coastal holiday 
                           in low season to keep you mentally well.
