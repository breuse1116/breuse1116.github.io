                <h2>Tiramisu French Toast Pancakes with Coffee Anglaise</h2>

                    This isn’t just French toast with coffee flavor added in. 
                    It’s French toast reimagined to have all the components of 
                    tiramisu in a not so traditional way. The coffee flavor gets
                    added in through the coffee anglaise which is like a thinner
                    pourable custard. The mascarpone is incorporated into a white 
                    chocolate whipped cream on top of the French toast. You don’t 
                    even need to drown this in maple syrup and butter because 
                    everything else is just too good.
