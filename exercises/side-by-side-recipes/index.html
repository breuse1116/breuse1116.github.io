                <h2>Tiramisu French Toast Pancakes with Coffee Anglaise</h2>
                <img src="images/french-toast.webp">
                <p>
                    This isn’t just French toast with coffee flavor added in. 
                    It’s French toast reimagined to have all the components of 
                    tiramisu in a not so traditional way. The coffee flavor gets
                    added in through the coffee anglaise which is like a thinner
                    pourable custard. The mascarpone is incorporated into a white 
                    chocolate whipped cream on top of the French toast. You don’t 
                    even need to drown this in maple syrup and butter because 
                    everything else is just too good.

                    <h2>Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supreme</h2>
                    <p>
                       These Crunchwrap Supremes are my version of Taco Bell at 
                       home, and even better. They’re layered with well-seasoned, 
                       saucy taco meat, a crisp tostada, and melted cheese, all 
                       wrapped and toasted until golden. Every bite hits that 
                       perfect balance of savory, crunchy, and cheesy. And they
                       are surpsingly easy to make so skip the drive thru the 
                       next time that craving hits.

                    <h2>Korean Inspired Tuna Melt</h2>
                    <p>
                        This Korean-inspired tuna melt is one of those recipes 
                        that I love making when I don’t feel like cooking but 
                        want something delicious. Spicy pepper tuna mixed with 
                        kimchi and kewpie mayo, layered with melty cheddar, and 
                        grilled between sourdough brushed with garlic butter — 
                        it’s bold, savory, and so so flavorful. If you think 
                        tuna melts are boring, this one will change your mind 
                        fast.

                    <h2>Greek Chicken and Potato Sheet Pan Bake</h2>
                    <p>
                        This Greek chicken and potato bake is all about letting 
                        a really good marinade do the heavy lifting. The chicken 
                        stays juicy with crisp skin while the potatoes roast 
                        around it, soaking up all that lemony, herby flavor. 
                        It’s simple, bold, and exactly the kind of dinner I make 
                        when I want something quick and easy but still really 
                        delicious.
