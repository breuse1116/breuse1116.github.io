                <h3>The Life of a Beagle Owners
                <h1>The Wonders of Beagles</h1>
                <h3>by Bonita Reuse</h3>- Feb 20, 2026
                <p>
                   <span><b>Their Constant Hunger:</b></span>
                   <br></br>
                        Beagles are <spn> <b>NEVER EVER</b></span> full. They constantly want to 
                        eat. Say you are leaving the house and wont be back til 
                        late, ok. You, being a good beagle parent, you dicide to
                        leave a giant bowl of food. Hoping they will just nibble
                        at it while you'e going, but instead they eat the entire
                        bowl as you are standing there. One can not make this 
                        story up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 <span><b>Their Constant Need for Attention:</b></span>
                    <p>
                        Their need for attention and/or petting is <span><b>
                        UNMATCHED</b></span> to no other created speciem on our
                        big green world. Don't you stop looking, playing or 
                        petting them <span><b>OR</b></span> you will be sorry.
                        They will gently or aggressively paw you to get your
                        attention.
                    
                </p>
                <span><b>They Bark A LOT!</b></span>
                <p>
                    They bark at everything. They will bark as they dream. They
                    bark at sounds, shadows, and strangers. They make it a 
                    point to announce their presence. As <span><b> ANNOYING</b>
                    as they are, you'll <span><b>NEVER</b></span> find a more loyal
                    family member than a beagle!
