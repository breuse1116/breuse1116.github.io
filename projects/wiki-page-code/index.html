            Crown shyness (also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup>
            canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sup> or inter-crown spacing<sup>
            [3]</sup>)</i> <b> is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, 
            in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each 
            other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> 
            The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same 
            species, but also occurs between trees of different 
            species.<sup>[6][7]</sup>There exist many hypotheses as to why 
            ßcrown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests 
            that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect 
            arvae.<sup>[8]</sup></p>
